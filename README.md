My project made for my faculty thesis.

You have to create local DB or use my DB that is in the project named DB.zip. 

If you use my database you can use this credentials. For normal user registration feature is working.
Uporabnik: admin
Geslo: Admin1234!

Uporabnik: Johnny

For admin rights you have to manually create admin user in DB table dbo.ASPNetUserRoles.
